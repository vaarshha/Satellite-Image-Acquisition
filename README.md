# Satellite-Image-Acquisition
A compilation of scripts for the acquisition of satellite images from Google Maps. This repository also features segmentation of roads and water bodies in the downloaded images.

## File Descriptions

- **get_coords**: Generates random coordinates within a given polygon defined by its boundary coordinates. Links to get the polygon of a place from OSM are in the file.

- **py_export**: Downloads images from Google Maps, given a specified layer (such as water or roads). Links to the original scripts: [Segmentation](https://gist.github.com/sebastianleonte/69a5f62220fbf25dca7de86c3b6d23ac) and [Download](https://gist.github.com/eskriett/6038468).
